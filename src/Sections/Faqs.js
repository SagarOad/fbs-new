              What methodology you use to complete the project?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Our delivery is a three phased approach â€“ Design, Develop and
              Launch. The design phase includes documentation and prototype. The
              next phase is application development which covers build, client
              demos and feedback. The final phase involves extensive testing,
              post-production support and next phase of implementation.

              How much does a custom software project costs to develop?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Every project has its overall cost based on several factors. After
              taking client requirments we give a ball park amount. If agreed,
              during the prototype design phase, we document all the client
              requirements for the project and provide exactly how much their
              project is going to cost in terms of money and time, which gives
              more transparency towards the delivery expectations by them.

              How long will my project take to complete?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Whether the project is based on modern or legacy systems, the
              delivery is dependent on the size and complexity of the project,
              and the number of resources allocated to it. The design phase, can
              take 2 - 6 weeks for most projects, while the development phase
              for non-complex projects can take 3 - 6 months. Medium complexity
              projects can take 6 - 12 months. Large, complex projects can take
              up to 12 - 24 months.
